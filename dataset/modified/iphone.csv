The reasons I switched was 1. Battery life of Oneplus 5t deteriorated rapidly and OnePlus hardly cared to explain this. I also suspected that OnePlus deliberately created a bug that led to sudden drop in battery life. 2. Wanted to get an Android phone but could not find even one decent phone that did not have heating issues. 3. Oneplus device also suffered from Screenburn.Having switched the battery life is sorted and the phone does not have any heating issues but iPhones lack basic features such as1. Display of date and time on status bar2. The rounded edges of the phone create a problem as some apps with options at the bottom of the screen are not properly displayed.3. Amazon App does not allow purchase if Kindle books on iOS devices.4.

Excellent phone as usual from Amazon;nice product;Father gift;This thing is a beast...Battery drain hi nahi hoti.# Nazar na lagey;Product is great;Heats up fastly and battery drops soon;"I switched from Oneplus 5t to iPhone 13. The reasons I switched was 1. Battery life of Oneplus 5t deteriorated rapidly and OnePlus hardly cared to explain this. I also suspected that OnePlus deliberately created a bug that led to sudden drop in battery life. 2. Wanted to get an Android phone but could not find even one decent phone that did not have heating issues. 3. Oneplus device also suffered from Screenburn.Having switched the battery life is sorted and the phone does not have any heating issues but iPhones lack basic features such as1. Display of date and time on status bar2. The rounded edges of the phone create a problem as some apps with options at the bottom of the screen are not properly displayed.3. Amazon App does not allow purchase if Kindle books on iOS devices.4. Typing is a problem as the screen is smaller compared to a OnePlus device.Overall;First and Foremost thing Camera its just okayish and Hyped one i found it to be equivalent to a 30-40 k range android phone.Battery Backup is top notchDisplay is good.IOS is really bad 😔 you can't tweak and play around like in android and you have to use itunes or a 3rd party app to just copy your files.For time being this is my review.
